# Crator - Next.js

This is modern dark agency template built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

This template is built using **Tailwind CSS v3** and **Next.js v13.4**, leveraging the latest [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) and server component functionalities.

## Getting Started

Unzip and open the folder of the theme with your editor of choice.

First, install the dependencies. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install  # if you have Yarn installed
```

This will install all required dependencies and place them in a folder called `node_modules` in the root directory.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to view the website.

## File Structure

All of the code for this template is located in the `/src` folder. The folder contains the following:

- `components` - Directory of reusable components
- `app` - Contains the site route components and layouts
- `styles` - Contains the entry point CSS file for Tailwind CSS
- `case-studies` - A directory of markdown files containing the case study content for the site.
- `lib` - Contains `caseStudies.js` which defines various data fetching functions for case studies.

Note that in order to more concisely import components, we defined a module path alias to the `/src` directory inside the `jsconfig.json` file at the root of our project. To learn more about module aliases you can check out [Vercel's documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases) on the subject.

## Tailwind CSS

This theme uses the latest version of Tailwind CSS: v3.3.

Tailwind CSS and its dependencies were installed via npm as recommended by the official [Tailwind installation docs for next.js](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs). If you are not familiar with the Tailwind CSS framework, I would recommend checking out the [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

You can find the `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files at the root of the directory. The entry point CSS file is located at `src/styles/tailwind.css`. This file only contains the `@tailwind` directives.

We've tried to minimize any custom CSS and only rely on Tailwind's utility classes and a few additional classes defined within the `tailwind.config.js` file. This template additionally uses 1 official Tailwind plugin: (`@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio`) to generate additional aspect ratio utility classes used across the site.

## Content

All of the case studies content for the site is stored in markdown files in the `src/case-studies` directory. Crator uses [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter), to parse the data from the markdown frontmatter content. Every case study content file has a corresponding `/work/<case-study>` page in the site where `<case-study>` is the name of the file.

### Adding new case studies

All of the case studies have data of the following form:

```

Every case study has page data fields (`hero`, `about`, `statsSection`, and `featuresSection`) corresponding to sections and components within the case study dynamic route page in `app/work/[slug]/page.jsx`. Every section is optional and is conditionally rendered in the dynamic route component:

```
export default function CaseStudyPage({ params: { slug } }) {
  const caseStudy = getCaseStudy(slug);

  return (
    <>
      {caseStudy?.hero && <CaseStudyHero data={caseStudy} />}
      {caseStudy?.about && <AboutCaseStudy data={caseStudy.about} />}
      {caseStudy?.statsSection && (
        <CaseStudyStats data={caseStudy.statsSection} />
      )}
      {caseStudy?.featuresSection && (
        <CaseStudyFeatures data={caseStudy.featuresSection} />
      )}
      <CallToAction />
    </>
  );
}
```

You can optionally set `featured: true` in order for the case study to be shown in the `<FeaturedWork/>` component in the `home` and `work` pages. Otherwise, it will be fetched in the `<ArchivedCaseStudies/>` component in the `work` page.
